# Micro: A tiny Micro.blog write-only client for Android

This project is extremely early! I threw it together just so I'd have a way to post to Micro.blog from my Android phone.

Feel free to fork it or submit PRs, or just to try it out yourself.

## To use:

1. Create a new app token from your [Micro.blog account page](https://micro.blog/account)
2. Copy the token you just created
3. Run Micro and you should see a dialog asking for your app token (if you don't, please let me know!)
4. Paste in your app token and tap "Save"
5. Now you can post updates to Micro.blog! Just type out your post and tap "Send"

## To do:

- [x] Take and store user app token
- [x] Send posts to hosted Micro.blog accounts
- [ ] Support for blogs not hosted by Micro.blog
- [ ] Clear text box after posting
- [ ] Character count
- [ ] Choose custom colours
- [ ] Improve design
- [ ] Check user's token before saving and showing success message
- [ ] Support for posting images
